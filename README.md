# Analyzing-River-Thames-Water-Levels
Time series data is everywhere, from watching your stock portfolio to monitoring climate change, and even live-tracking as local cases of a virus become a global pandemic. In this project, you’ll work with a time series that tracks the tide levels of the Thames River. You’ll first load the data and inspect it data visually, and then perform calculations on the dataset to generate some summary statistics. You’ll end by decomposing the time series into its component attributes and analyzing them.

The original dataset is available from the British Oceanographic Data Center here and you can read all about this fascinating archival story in this article from the Nature journal.
